vitag allows you to edit ID3, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC tags with your favorite text
editor (thus the name). Usage is pretty simple. Run the script with any amount
of MP3, Vorbis and FLAC files as parameters and use the powerful features of
your $EDITOR to edit the tags. After saving your changes and exiting the
$EDITOR the script will apply the changes to the audio files.

Note on FLAC: Because of how metaflac works, some FLAC tags may get lost at the
current state of vitag.

Requirements:

- vorbiscomment (comes with vorbis-tools)
- id3tag, id3info (comes with id3lib)
- file, mktemp, cat, cmp (UNIX core utils)
- metaflac (comes with flac)
