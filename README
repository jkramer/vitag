vitag allows you to edit ID3 and Ogg Vorbis tags with your favorite text editor
(that's where the name comes from). Usage is pretty simple. Run the script with
any amount of MP3 and Vorbis files as parameters and use the powerful features
of your $EDITOR to edit the tags. After saving your changes and exiting the
$EDITOR the script will apply the changes to the audio files.

Requirements:

- vorbiscomment (comes with vorbis-tools)
- id3tag, id3info (comes with id3lib)
- file, mktemp, cat, cmp (UNIX core utils)
